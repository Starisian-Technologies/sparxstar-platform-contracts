# Mehns

## What Is This?

Mehns is a DVE subsystem for **audio quality analytics and logging**. It tracks audio characteristics, transcription success rates, and performance metrics across the voice pipeline—providing visibility into system health and opportunities for improvement.

## Why You Need It

Voice systems are only as good as your data. Mehns gives you:

- **Quality Metrics** — Understand audio quality before transcription
- **Success Tracking** — See which audio conditions cause failures
- **Performance Analytics** — Identify bottlenecks in the pipeline
- **Trend Analysis** — Spot patterns over time (e.g., peak load hours)
- **Operational Alerts** — Get notified when quality degrades

## Quick Overview

| Aspect        | Detail                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Audio analytics and quality logging               |
| **Tracks**    | Audio characteristics, success rates, performance |
| **Consumers** | Ops teams, quality engineers, product analytics   |
| **Part Of**   | DVE (Digital Voice Engine)                        |

## What It Measures

- Audio bitrate, sample rate, duration
- Noise levels and signal-to-noise ratio
- Transcription success/failure rates
- Latency through each pipeline stage
- User corrections and quality feedback
- Language distribution and patterns

## How It Works

1. **Capture** — Audio properties logged as files enter DVE
2. **Track** — Transcription outcomes recorded
3. **Aggregate** — Metrics compiled over time periods
4. **Alert** — Thresholds trigger operational notifications
5. **Report** — Data available for analytics dashboards

Mehns runs continuously; you typically don't interact with it directly.

## Getting Started

Mehns data is accessed through operational dashboards and metrics APIs (not shown in contract interfaces).

To understand your voice pipeline's health:

- Monitor transcription success rates
- Track average audio quality scores
- Watch for spikes in processing latency
- Review user correction patterns

## Important Notes

- **Automatic** — Mehns logs transparently; no configuration needed
- **Non-blocking** — Analytics don't slow down transcription
- **Retention policies** — Mehns data follows compliance schedules
- **Privacy aware** — Audio content is never logged; only metadata
