/**
 * Sirus Client Interface
 *
 * Contract for consuming context and signals from the SPARXSTAR Sirus Context
 * plugin (https://github.com/Starisian-Technologies/sparxstar-sirus-context).
 *
 * Helios CONSUMES from Sirus; it never WRITES to Sirus. Specifically:
 * - Device context: Sirus provides enriched device data; Helios binds sessions
 *   to the device_hash, but does not generate the hash itself when Sirus is
 *   present.
 * - Signals: Sirus computes network/behavioral signals; Helios passes them to
 *   TrustEngine for evaluation. Helios does NOT compute signals internally.
 *
 * Enforcement boundary: Helios enforces; Sirus observes. No session mutation
 * or trust state change may originate inside a SirusClientInterface
 * implementation.
 *
 * @package    SparxStar\Helios\Contracts
 * @since      1.0.0
